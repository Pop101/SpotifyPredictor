## Introduction

We are going to be analysing a dataset of songs from Spotify.
Containing {len(load_data("SpotifyFeatures"))} songs, we will be looking at the 
derived features of each song and how they affect the popularity of the song.

We will be using a linear combination of LASSO regression, a random forest classifier,
and principal component analysis to determine
feature significance. This combination allows for wholistic analysis of the data,
performing feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and classification between
the many features of the dataset.

Performing this analysis, we can see the following feature importance:

Note how Genre is the most important indicator of popularity. This is because
some genres are simply more in the public lens than many others.

However, we can also see that artists are fairly unimportant. This is an
interesting result, as it means that the popularity of a song is rather independant
from the established artist handle many musicians have. This could also be furthered
by Spotify itself, which frequently pushes "radios" of songs that are have similar
features but not necessarily the same artist.

Because genre seems to be the biggest single indicator,
let's examine the popularity of each genre:

This chart shows that the most popular genres are Pop, Rap, and Rock.
This is not surprising, as these are simple the most played genres
across both Spotify and music in general.

Children's music is also surprisingly popular, but this is likely due to
the number of children able to access Spotify, which has grown sharply
in the recent decade.

Breaking down genres, we can examine the feature profile specific to each to
determine what makes a genre unique and what makes a song popular within that genre.

Note that hit songs are the top 15% of songs within their genre,
while unpopular ones are the bottom 25%. Looking at these
extremes will help us determine what differentiates good from great.

The accuracy of the decision tree is **{accuracy:.2%}**, that is,
if your song falls within a popular leaf, it is **{accuracy:.2%}** likely to be popular.

This is fairly good, considering the simplicity of the decision tree, however,
it also attests to the difficulty of creating hit songs.
Among hit songs, the accuracy is **{accuracy_hits:.2%}**.
These songs are the most difficult to predict, as they occur within all genres
and with any combination of features, all while being extremely rare.

A more complex model, such as a neural network, could be used to improve
this accuracy, however, it would be much more difficult to interpret and explain.
